# Snake
This is the snake game recreated!

## Structure
- `food.py` are objects the snake can eat to grow.
- `highscore.text` stores the all time highscore.
- `scoreboard.py` tracks the points and displays them on the screen.
- `snake.py` is the main blocks shaped and behaving like a snake which the user controls. There is also collision detection on walls and with self set causing the user to lose and restart automatically with a score of 0.
- `main.py` ties together all classes and behaves as the nucleus
## Dependencies & Configurations
1. The program utilizes [turtle graphics](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) for all the graphical displays.
